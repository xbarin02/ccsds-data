frame.pgm 1920x1080 16-bit big-endian
- a frame from the PersonenAmTischMitColorChart2 video sequence used within the SAUCE project
- obtained using: ppmtopgm 00000.ppm > frame.pgm
- which expect the values in PGM/PPM are already gamma corrected
- From the PGM manual: Each gray value is a number proportional to the intensity of the pixel, adjusted by the ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 gamma transfer function.
- From the PPM manual: In the raster, the sample values are "nonlinear." They are proportional to the intensity of the ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 red, green, and blue in the pixel, adjusted by the BT.709 gamma transfer function.

m612-be.pgm 2564x5117 12-bit big-endian
