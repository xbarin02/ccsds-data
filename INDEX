- From the PGM manual: Each gray value is a number proportional to the intensity of the pixel, adjusted by the ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 gamma transfer function.
- From the PPM manual: In the raster, the sample values are "nonlinear." They are proportional to the intensity of the ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 red, green, and blue in the pixel, adjusted by the BT.709 gamma transfer function.
